# Overview

This MCP server provides instant weather information for any location on demand. Users simply ask about the weather in a specific place, and the server returns the current weather condition and temperature. Beyond current conditions, it also supports future forecasts, letting users specify how far ahead they want to look. This makes it a convenient, conversational tool for quickly checking weather without navigating traditional weather apps or websites.

The inputs from the user that the mcp server takes in are **Location** and **Range of Data Wanted**
